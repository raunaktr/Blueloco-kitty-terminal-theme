# Bluloco kitty terminal theme


This theme is inspired by [Bluloco Dark Theme](https://github.com/uloco/theme-bluloco-dark). Special thanks to the [Umut TopuzoÄŸlu](https://github.com/uloco/), developer of this theme and my endevours for ricing my terminal that stands perfectly with VS Code.

## Requirements

This repository requires the following modules:
1. [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), highly customizable and fast terminal based emulators.
2. MacOS or Linux based Operating System.

## How to use?

1. To install kitty on Arch based Operating system, use `sudo pacman -S kitty`.
2. Clone this repo using 
 `git clone https://github.com/raunaktr/Bluloco-kitty-terminal-theme.git` 
command in your home repository. (_You can remove it later_)

3. `cd Bluloco-kitty-terminal-theme/` in your kitty terminal.
4. Now, copy `Bluloco-dark.conf` in kitty configuration files using.
 ` cp Bluloco-dark.conf ~/.config/kitty/kitty-themes/themes/`
5. Now, make a symbolic link of Bluloco-dark.conf to kitty's theme.conf. Use,

>`ln -s ~/.config/kitty/kitty-themes/themes/Bluloco-dark.conf ~/.config/kitty/theme.conf`.



As the developer of this theme said, give it a try :)
